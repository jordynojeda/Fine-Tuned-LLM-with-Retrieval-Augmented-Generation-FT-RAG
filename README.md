# FineRAG

**Fine-Tuning a Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Domain-Specific Question Answering**

## Overview

FineRAG is a full-stack LLM application that combines fine-tuning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to build a domain-adapted, context-aware question answering system. This project demonstrates how to personalize a foundational language model and enhance its capabilities through dynamic knowledge retrieval from external documents.

By fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on custom data and integrating it with a vector-based retrieval system, FineRAG bridges the gap between static model knowledge and dynamic, real-world information needs.

## Key Features

- ✅ **LLM Fine-Tuning**  
  Fine-tuned a transformer-based language model using domain-specific text data to improve response relevance and tone.

- 🔍 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Built a retrieval pipeline using vector similarity search (e.g., FAISS/Chroma) to inject relevant context into each user query.

- 🧠 **End-to-End Pipeline**  
  Combines document ingestion, embedding generation, context retrieval, and response generation in a seamless flow.

- 💬 **Question Answering Interface**  
  Accepts user questions and returns grounded, source-aware answers with traceable context snippets.
